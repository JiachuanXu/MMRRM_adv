This is the format instruction for the arguments(default: args_mmrrm_adv.dat, you can change the definition in mmrrm_adv.h)
While running the program, rename the arguments involved as "args_mmrrm_adv.dat", or copy the content into this file.
But you are free to name the arguments to your own convenience.
